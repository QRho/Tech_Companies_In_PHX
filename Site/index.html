  <div class="col-md-12"> <h4 class='line'><br> In this chart, we wanted to break down the areas these companies are located in. As you can see, Scottsdale and Phoenix alone make up for 70% of the companies in the area.
    Understandably these these areas are rich with commerce and new companies. If you live in an area with less tech companies like Mesa for instance you might have to consider commuting to work.</h4>

<div class="col-md-12"> <br> <h4 class='line'>In this chart, we wanted to show the different types of funding that the software companies in the area have. While most of them are self-funded, there are quite a few that are VC-Funded.<br><br> VC-Funded is when a firm has equity in the company since they have shown to have a good customer base along with a revenue strategy. <br><br>There are also quite a few companies that are considered Angel or Seed Funded, which means investors are involved with a company that is in the very early stages of starting up and possibly no customer base.

<div class="col-md-12"><h4 class='line'> <br> In our final chart, we wanted to look at the different size companies that are here in the Phoenix area. <br>As you can see, the majority of the software companies are on the smaller range. 69% of the companies have 50 employees or less.<br>
  Company size can have a large impact on the work environment as well as benefits and company culture. Think to yourself about the difference between working for a mom and pop business versus a corporation. Some people prefer to work for larger companies while others prefer smaller ones. Think about what your preference might be and you can target your search to that criteria.
